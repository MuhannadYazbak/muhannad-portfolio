Hi, I'm Muhannad Yazbak â€” a Full-Stack Developer & QA Automation Engineer.

I build scalable web apps and automation suites using modern tools like Next.js, Docker, Playwright, and CI/CD pipelines.

My latest project, TechMart, started as a learning showcase and is evolving into a product-grade e-commerce platform. Stay tuned!
