                        It all started when I visited my cousin, a mobile store/lab owner who casually asked<br />
                        Muhannad are you able to develop a website? and he described some basic requirments.<br />
                        Few days later I decided to develop a Full-Stack showcase fulfilling his requirments</p>

                        TechMart was originally supposed to be built with React.js.<br />
                        I opened my terminal, typed <code>npx create-react-app</code>, and boom—deprecated.<br />
                        The official docs nudged me toward <code>create-next-app</code>, and that’s when the pivot happened.<br />
                        What started as a simple frontend idea quickly evolved into a full-stack eCommerce showcase.<br />
                        I didn’t just switch frameworks—I switched mindsets.

                        My cousin’s original requirements? Already surpassed. Routing, SSR, API routes,<br />
                        dynamic pages—I had it all humming. What started as a challenge quickly became a playground.

                        Once the frontend felt solid, I dove into the backend. I started sketching out architecture<br />
                        with PlantUML—visualizing flows, data models, and service boundaries.<br />
                        Then came Playwright: basic automation to test flows like checkout, login, and product search.<br />
                        Suddenly, I wasn’t just building—I was engineering. At that point I called the project TechMart.

                        I wanted reliability, not just functionality. So I added Docker to containerize<br />
                        the app—clean, portable, and ready for deployment.<br />
                        Then came GitHub Actions: CI pipelines that lint, test, and deploy with every push.<br />
                        From local dev to cloud-ready in one sprint.

                        I processed my showcase turned into a production-grade, great news but something was still missing.<br />
                        So, I participated in a job hunt workshop and realized I have to update my CV and my LinkedIn profile<br />
                        made those changes step by step, until now I have a polished CV and proactive LinkedIn profile with TechMart brand posts. <br />

                        👧 I had a tiny visitor — my cousin’s daughter, a soon-to-be 2nd grader.<br />
                        She peeked over my shoulder while I was deep into manual exploratory testing and asked:“Muhannad, are you buying a new phone?”<br />
                        That moment made me smile — because it meant my frontend was so clear, even a 7-year-old thought she was on a real e-commerce site.<br />
                        I replied with a metaphor she could grasp:“No, I’m building the site that sells phones — like my own Shein version.

                    <p className="max-w-3xl text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed transition-transform hover:scale-110">
                        I set out to ensure quality and precision across TechMart’s codebase, so I kicked off a GitHub Actions CI pipeline. Simple goal, complex journey.<br />
                        The beginning was rocky—wrangling YAML syntax, sequencing steps, and learning the quirks of GitHub’s runner environment.<br />
                        I thought I had it nailed… until the first run: 58 out of 62 tests failed, despite passing locally.<br />
                        That’s when the real work began.<br />
                        I re-engineered the pipeline with a mock-driven approach, tailored for SSR and metadata fetches.<br />
                        Each test was dissected, optimized, and rebuilt to reflect real-world behavior. The result? 100% pass rate, both locally and in CI.<br />
                        And the cherry on top: I slashed the runtime from ~17 minutes to just ~5 minutes, with test execution clocking in at ~37 seconds.

                    <p className="max-w-3xl text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed transition-transform hover:scale-110">
                        TechMart was engineered with <strong>AuthContext</strong>, <strong>bcrypt.js</strong>, and <strong>JWT-based authentication</strong> using hash and salt.<br />
                        All routes are role-protected by default. But during a casual UX research sprint, I discovered that most users dislike being forced to log in just to explore.<br />
                        So I introduced a new role: <strong>Guest</strong>.<br />
                        Guests can browse freely, add items to their cart, and even proceed with a minimal checkout flow—no signup required.<br />
                        I validated this direction with a live LinkedIn poll, and the results confirmed the need for frictionless access.
