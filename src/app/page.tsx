        <article id='headline'>Hi, <strong>I'm Muhannad Yazbak</strong> â€” a Full-Stack Developer and QA Automation Engineer with a dual academic background in Medical Laboratory Science and Information Systems.<br />
          I specialize in building scalable web applications and robust automation suites using modern technologies like Next.js, Docker, Playwright, and CI/CD pipelines. My work blends precision, performance, and a deep curiosity for how systems behave in real-world environments.<br />
          My latest project, TechMart, began as a solo learning challenge and is now evolving into a product-grade e-commerce platform. It taught me more than any course could â€” from architecture decisions to deployment strategies.
          I'm passionate about health-tech innovation and excited to contribute to systems that improve lives through technology.</article>
